# Firmware Validation for a PC Component

For a PC component, the RIM is created as a Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)-encoded file. 
The RIM-Tool supports the [TCG Component RIM](../RIMs/tcg-component-rim.md), the 
[CoSWID Tag](../RIMs/coswid.md), and the [CoRIM](../RIMs/corim.md).

## Reference Integrity Manifest Specifications for a PC Component

* The
[TCG Component Reference Integrity Manifest Information Model :fontawesome-solid-external-link:](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tcg-component-reference-integrity-manifest-information-model/)
complements the RIM Information Model by defining a Component Reference Integrity Manifest (RIM)
Information Model (IM) for components of a platform, e.g., a PC Client or Server platform.
* The [TCG Component RIM Binding for SWID/CoSWID :fontawesome-solid-external-link:](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG-Component-RIM-Binding-for-SWID-and-CoSWID-Version-1.0-Revision-22_9October24.pdf)
complies with the TCG Component RIM Information Model Specification and provides additional requirements
for a SWID/CoSWID RIM file.
